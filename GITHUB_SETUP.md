# GitHub Setup Instructions

## 🚀 Push Your Project to GitHub

Your local git repository is ready! Follow these steps to push it to GitHub:

### Option 1: Using GitHub CLI (Recommended)
If you have GitHub CLI installed:

```bash
# Create a new repository on GitHub and push
gh repo create CINIC10-Deep-Learning-Project --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

### Option 2: Manual Setup

1. **Create a new repository on GitHub:**
   - Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
   - Click "New repository" or go to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
   - Repository name: `CINIC10-Deep-Learning-Project`
   - Description: `Complete deep learning pipeline for CINIC-10 image classification with MLP and CNN implementations`
   - Make it **Public** (recommended for portfolio)
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
   - Click "Create repository"

2. **Connect your local repository to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   cd "/Users/innocentchikwanda/Desktop/Grad School/Deep Learning/Prosit1"
   
   # Add the remote repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/CINIC10-Deep-Learning-Project.git
   
   # Push your code to GitHub
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Verify the upload:**
   - Visit your repository on GitHub
   - You should see all your files including the comprehensive README.md

## 📁 Repository Structure

Your repository now contains:

```
