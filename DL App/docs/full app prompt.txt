Create a full-stack application for predicting the class of a 32x32 image from among 10 image classes. The model is the one in this folder: (feedforward_cinic10.pth). The application should have a user-friendly interface that allows users to upload an image and get a prediction. The application should be deployed on a web server and should be accessible from a web browser. 

The application should have the following features:

1. A user-friendly interface that allows users to upload an image and get a prediction.
2. The application should be deployed on a web server and should be accessible from a web browser.
3. The application should have a user-friendly interface that allows users to upload an image and get a prediction.
4. The application should be deployed on a web server and should be accessible from a web browser.
5. The application should have a modern interface (refer to the frontend files in this directory)
6. The app should be optimized for fast response time and low latency
7. Do local development and testing first, once that succeeds proceed to web deployment
8. Use the frontend documented in the Elegant Image Classification App folder
9. Keep a log of all the changes you have made and the plan

Current steps:
Review the whole project and restructure file order optimally
Use the model.py to guide your understanding of how the model was trained
